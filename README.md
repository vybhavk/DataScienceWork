# Online-Challenge
Challenge submitted on HackerRank and Kaggle.

Algorithm challenges are made on HackerRank using Python.

Data Science and Machine Learning challenges are made on Kaggle using Python too. 

## [Kaggle Bike Sharing](https://github.com/alexattia/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/KaggleBikeSharing)
The goal of this challenge is to build a model that predicts the count of bike shared, exclusively based on contextual features. The first part of this challenge was aimed to understand, to analyse and to process those dataset. I wanted to produce meaningful information with plots. The second part was to build a model and use a Machine Learning library in order to predict the count.
